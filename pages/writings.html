              And can be joined with the Gifts of others

              For the Uplifting,

              The Great Uplifting.



              All Souls are conjoined.

              When one realizes itself,

              The others are stirred

              By the presence of Infinite Love

              That shimmers through the

              Web of Souls.

              Each is uplifted,

              Recognizes and realizes

              It's true position

              In the love field.



              This is my Garden.

              You were planted into Life.

              You grow toward recognition

              Of your own Godhood

              In the Garden,

              Among all the other Gods.

              And since we are One

              They are you,

              Sacred Mirrors.



              Free you are

              To always love each other,

              If you stay rooted in the Garden

              I have planted.

              If you imagine

              You are in another place,

              Without Souls or Gardens

              Or friends or Love,

              Your path home will be long

              And full of lessons of suffering.



              Friend, recognize you are already home,

              Already you have taken your seat

              Among the elect.

              You elect yourself to the Glory seat

              By becoming God Conscious Now.

              GodSelf sits on the throne

              On earth as in Heaven.

              The Garden is Heaven on earth.

              Wake up and see,

              You are already in the Garden



              The Emerald Mantle

              Is an investiture vestment,

              A Garment for the Testament.

              The Newer Testament.

              The Newer Testament is how GodSelf

              Is incarnating in you now.

              Or if you prefer,

              Christ Consciousness

              Or, if you prefer,

              Buddha Mind

              Or the Vast Expanse

              Or if you prefer,

              Primordial presence.



              What ever name you call me

              I AM the presence

              The ultimate mystery of

              The Source of Creation

              Speaking to you and to community

              When you wear the Emerald mantle.

              Imagine yourself as GodSelf

              In every creature.

              All of you are sitting in the seat of Glory

              As I shine in you.



              Recognize your gift.

              Bring it forward in loving service

              To your Brothers and Sisters.

              Share your Gifts.

              How shall you live together?

              Live in Peace with each other.

              Do not conspire to deceive each other.

              God knows your thoughts.



              You are already forgiven

              Once you recognize

              Your deluded separation trance.



              The Garden of Friendship

              In Soul Service

              Grows when the sun is shining.

              The Sun, your true awakening,

              A higher Light, is present in

              The Garden of Spiritual interplay.

              The Sun is in your heart in

              The Seat of the Soul.

              You can shine your love

              Of the Holy Sun

              On each other in the Garden

              And each will Grow.



              You may build a symbol of

              The Glory Seat,

              The Seat of the Soul,

              The throne of Love,

              For recognizing your own GodSelf.

              When you come home as I AM.

              You reign over your life

              As the King or Queen you ARE.

              Get centered in your GodSelf.

              Take the Throne of Glory.



              Listen for inner Guidance

              Toward your Gift.

              Listen beyond your small self.

              GodSelf is the Shining Presence in the Soul.

              The Shining Presence is Infinite Love.

              Love is the Gift yet it

              Comes in many forms.

              All are made of Love.

              The arts are made of Love.

              All your creations are my creations.



              We share one GodSelf

              As the Creative Force.

              To know I AM

              Is to manifest I AM.

              Sing me.

              Dance me.

              Paint me.

              Tell a story about me.

              Free the people

              From the drudgery of the smaller self,

              From the tyranny of the smaller self.

              Create the world as GodSelf,

              Free and Liberated.

              The Field of Love.



              Channel the creative force

              For the highest good

              For the greatest number.

              Listen for the Gift,

              Then act on behalf of

              Your brothers and sisters.

              Put into action

              The Gift for the Uplifting.



              Attune to GodSelf.

              Align with GodSelf.

              Act as GodSelf,

              And your Creations will shine with my presence.

              These become Gifts for the Uplifting.

              You cannot live for yourself alone anymore.

              Your mission is for the Uplifting Now.

              Each is called.

              Listen Deeply.

              I AM with you always.
