              And can be joined with the Gifts of others
              For the Uplifting,
              The Great Uplifting.

              All Souls are conjoined.
              When one realizes itself,
              The others are stirred
              By the presence of Infinite Love
              That shimmers through the
              Web of Souls.
              Each is uplifted,
              Recognizes and realizes
              It's true position
              In the love field.

              This is my Garden.
              You were planted into Life.
              You grow toward recognition
              Of your own Godhood
              In the Garden,
              Among all the other Gods.
              And since we are One
              They are you,
              Sacred Mirrors.

              Free you are
              To always love each other,
              If you stay rooted in the Garden
              I have planted.
              If you imagine
              You are in another place,
              Without Souls or Gardens
              Or friends or Love,
              Your path home will be long
              And full of lessons of suffering.

              Friend, recognize you are already home,
              Already you have taken your seat
              Among the elect.
              You elect yourself to the Glory seat
              By becoming God Conscious Now.
              GodSelf sits on the throne
              On earth as in Heaven.
              The Garden is Heaven on earth.
              Wake up and see,
              You are already in the Garden

              The Emerald Mantle
              Is an investiture vestment,
              A Garment for the Testament.
              The Newer Testament.
              The Newer Testament is how GodSelf
              Is incarnating in you now.
              Or if you prefer,
              Christ Consciousness
              Or, if you prefer,
              Buddha Mind
              Or the Vast Expanse
              Or if you prefer,
              Primordial presence.

              What ever name you call me
              I AM the presence
              The ultimate mystery of
              The Source of Creation
              Speaking to you and to community
              When you wear the Emerald mantle.
              Imagine yourself as GodSelf
              In every creature.
              All of you are sitting in the seat of Glory
              As I shine in you.

              Recognize your gift.
              Bring it forward in loving service
              To your Brothers and Sisters.
              Share your Gifts.
              How shall you live together?
              Live in Peace with each other.
              Do not conspire to deceive each other.
              God knows your thoughts.

              You are already forgiven
              Once you recognize
              Your deluded separation trance.

              The Garden of Friendship
              In Soul Service
              Grows when the sun is shining.
              The Sun, your true awakening,
              A higher Light, is present in
              The Garden of Spiritual interplay.
              The Sun is in your heart in
              The Seat of the Soul.
              You can shine your love
              Of the Holy Sun
              On each other in the Garden
              And each will Grow.

              You may build a symbol of
              The Glory Seat,
              The Seat of the Soul,
              The throne of Love,
              For recognizing your own GodSelf.
              When you come home as I AM.
              You reign over your life
              As the King or Queen you ARE.
              Get centered in your GodSelf.
              Take the Throne of Glory.

              Listen for inner Guidance
              Toward your Gift.
              Listen beyond your small self.
              GodSelf is the Shining Presence in the Soul.
              The Shining Presence is Infinite Love.
              Love is the Gift yet it
              Comes in many forms.
              All are made of Love.
              The arts are made of Love.
              All your creations are my creations.

              We share one GodSelf
              As the Creative Force.
              To know I AM
              Is to manifest I AM.
              Sing me.
              Dance me.
              Paint me.
              Tell a story about me.
              Free the people
              From the drudgery of the smaller self,
              From the tyranny of the smaller self.
              Create the world as GodSelf,
              Free and Liberated.
              The Field of Love.

              Channel the creative force
              For the highest good
              For the greatest number.
              Listen for the Gift,
              Then act on behalf of
              Your brothers and sisters.
              Put into action
              The Gift for the Uplifting.

              Attune to GodSelf.
              Align with GodSelf.
              Act as GodSelf,
              And your Creations will shine with my presence.
              These become Gifts for the Uplifting.
              You cannot live for yourself alone anymore.
              Your mission is for the Uplifting Now.
              Each is called.
              Listen Deeply.
              I AM with you always.

              How many times a day are you praying?
              You can say that your life or your art is a prayer, but is it?
              Are you haphazard about your connection with God?
              Does your prayer or your practice leave you ecstatically melted into Godhood?
              Or are your days a dreary blur?

              Rigor is called for.
              Waver your line and your drawing is wrong, weak, unobservant.
              Bring your commitment to the line between your soul and the Infinite.
              Increase your powers of sharp observation.
              Draw yourself closer to God.
              Feel the hug of the Absolute and Thank Grace for your breath.
              For a Saint, every breath is a prayer.
              Ever mindful, every step for a monk brings them toward Buddha or Christ.
              Even to merging with BuddhaMind or Christ Consciousness,
              Walking their body like a good master walks a dog,
              So walk your God.

              Draw your God.
              Breath your God.
              Divine remembrance
              And the parched soil of your Soul
              Absorbs the perpetual rain of Love going on.
              Eternally you are bathed, baptized in Light and Love.

              Are you feeling it?
              Come closer.
              Hear your blood pumping?
              It’s a thunderstorm of Love.
              Taste your saliva?
              Who is not anointed?
              When you are dead you are home.
              Why forget God when your bones are moved by the Infinite One?
              Your body is prayer.
              Let your breath be Gods kiss.
              Smile in the Bliss of Divine Remembrance
              And the elaborate trap of the EarthBody,
              With your specific life story
              And all the woe and weeping
              Is consumed in the Transcendental Sun.

              Radiant now.
              Keep breathing, the air is prayer.
              Feel the warm tingles in your flesh?
              That is the gentle fire of Divine Remembrance.
              The sunshine of your Soul
              Shine on.
              The angels are calling you to prayer.

              Listen, Noble One(s).
              Consider yourself called
              By your own Transcendental Ground of Being
              To return to the consciousness of Source Reality,
              Vast as Space.
              Beyond All Time.
              Beyond the Boundaries of your skin.
              Open your Being to its intrinsic Oneness with all beings and things,
              To Witness Consciousness
              To Primordial Awareness
              To Freedom from Suffering,
              To Supreme Liberation.
              Melt the walls of your imprisoned Soul.
              Let the acid of Self-Realization eat away all constrictions, boundaries and obstacles
              To accessing your own Divinity,
              Your own GodSelf.
              Yes, of course, you have a body.
              Just don't limit your identity to that.
              Yes, you have desires, emotions, thoughts
              Running through your consciousness,
              But just see them as limited stations of identity
              Along the path to your True Nature.
              Before you constrain your selfhood to the limits you are familiar with,
              Notice you are already home in source reality,
              Your Oneness with the Boundless Ocean of Love Bliss
              Is your Original Soul Dimension.

              Love melts the self-constrictions to Soul.
              The Voice that calls is Love itself
              Calling you home.
              Consider yourself called.

              Now home in the Oneness
              Seeing through God's Eyes.
              Hearing with God's Ears.
              We are all extensions of the Oneness.
              Imagine XYZ axis
              Extending infinitely in each direction.
              Thou art that.
              Imagine all the Galactic Clusters in the Cosmos
              Occurring on the backdrop of your Limitless Space.
              Thou art That.
              Imagine all events from the Beginning of Time
              Till its collapse as a sparkle of luminosity in your vastness.
              Thou art that.

              In order to create, the Creator prepares a Blank Canvas.
              Imagine the next moment as your Blank Canvas,
              Free as the Creative Force.
              What reality will you bring to life?

              1. God creates the cosmos with love.
              2. When we create with love we align ourselves with the god force.
              3. The cosmos and our world is god's evolving creation, an unfinished masterpiece we each co-create.
              4. Love will go to any length to fulfill its creation.
              5. We are each a finite mirror of god's infinite creation.
              6. To see through appearances to god's transcendent presence beatifies and transfigures our experience of
              god's immanent creation.
              7. Creating sacred space mirrors god's creation.
              8. Our challenge as co-creators is to mirror god's love in all our creations.
              9. All action is creation more or less conscious.
              10. The plan is to unmask the illusion of separation.
              11. The plan can only be enacted by becoming conscious co-creators.
              12. Reflection is the process by which we increase and unleash our higher greater deeper consciousness.
              13. Infinite consciousness is a mirror of god's presence boundless and all inclusive.
              14. Infinite mind knows the perfection of all as it is in each moment and feels the infinite love that
              sees and acts on the unfinished masterpiece to create a world that more effectively mirrors god.
              15. The cosmos and our own lives are gifts of love from the creator.
              16. A permanent thankfuless for the gifts is one benefit of realization.
              17. Realization is awakening more or less to the plan and our own role in the evolving creation.
              18. Creativity is a sacred mirror and path to realization.
              19. A new alliance of spirit and humanity is being created through sacred art.
              20. Seeing and being is a creation.
              21. Creativity is holy, a path to recover our wholeness, a spiritual path capable of catalyzing our
              self-realization.
              22. Become a worthy conduit of god's love and creative power of realization.
              23. Like a lightning flash, when conditions are present, the light suddenly fills us, illuminating the
              world for an instant.
              24. Meet god in the storm of life and be a conductor of divine radiance.
              25. The example of your light can set off a chain reaction of pentacostal soulfire.
              26. Soulfire is the passion to perform acts, to create in accordance with divine law.
              27. The timeless enters the creative field of history when called, and human religion mirrors the evolving
              waves of spiritual alliances.
              28. Now religion is the blank canvas of creative energy. The new alliance has annointed creativity as a
              worthy conduit.
              29. Now is art a blessed path to inspirational ecstasy, the fusion of spirit and matter for the uplifting.
              30. The great uplifting of humanity beyond its self-destruction is the redemptive calling of art.
              31. Remove the blocks to your creative plasma state. The heart is a safe container for such a power.
              32. The plasma state of soulfire in the heart is the welding torch of love fusing god and human together.
              33. A well lit soulfire can burn away obstacles to the divine for thousands of years.
              34. Sacred space mirrors the heart as a pumphouse for communal soulfire.
              35. The creation of sacred space is a calling of the highest and deepest urgency as a new model for
              possible futures.
              36. Humanity must be awakened and creative spirituality has a vital and healing role in the archetype of
              an undogmatic and lovingly ecstatic religion. All are called to see their own divine incompletion and
              unfinished masterpiece status.
              37. Building sacred space together is a task beyond our individuality to which we can dedicate ourselves
              and prove the possibility of people getting along and making something beautiful together.
              38. The dawn of planetary consciousness is up to each of us as artists of inner light.
              39. Our combined light can blast the psycho evolutionary process into creative overdrive, inventing new
              ways to save the temple of love, our earthly life web.
              40. All creatures are holy and each are god's children. Revere and protect them and their home.
              41. Humanity grieve actively over your slaughter of nature by committing acts of collective preservation.
              42. Preservation and renewal of what remains of the lifeweb is still a possibility.
              43. Science and spirituality must combine forces through art, bridging knowledge with wisdom, entering
              history through creative action.
              44. Forgiveness of humanity by the web of life will begin when rituals of confession of wrongdoing are
              enacted worldwide and prayers for healing the lifeweb are collectively engaged in.
              45. Whether the new alliance of collective intelligences can save the unfinished masterpiece of life on
              earth is unknown, however, the plan is underway.

              WORLDSPIRIT
              is a prayer
              For the realization of our integration with
              the web of creation
              and for the transformation of our species
              from one gripped in fear and self annihilation
              to a species that stands for love,
              wildly creative peace, and liberation.

              Art can be worship and service.
              The incandescent core of our soul,
              A glowing God's eye,
              infinitely aware of the beauty of creation,
              Is interlocked with a network of souls,
              part of one vast group soul.
              The group soul of art beyond time
              comes into time
              By projecting music and symbols
              Into the imagination.
              God's radiant grace fills the heart and mind
              with these gifts.
              The artist honors the gifts of sound and vision
              by weaving them into works of art
              and sharing them with the community.
              The community uses them as wings
              to soar to the same shining vistas and beyond.

              Translucent wings teem with eyes of flame
              on the mighty cherub of Art.
              Arabesques of fractal cherub wings enfold
              and uplift the world.
              The loom of creation is anointed
              with fresh spirit and blood.
              Phoenix-like, the soul of art,
              resurrects from the ashes of isms.
              Transfusions from living primordial traditions
              empower the artist.
              Take them to the heights and depths
              Necessary to find the medicine of the moment,
              A new image and song of the Infinite One,
              God of Creation
              Manifesting effulgently,
              multidimensionally,
              With the same empty fullness
              that Buddha knew
              And the same compassionate healing
              that Jesus spread.
              Krishna plays his flute
              the Goddess dances
              And the entire tree of life vibrates
              with the power of love.
              A mosaic and tilemaker inspired by Rumi
              finds infinite patterns of connectivity
              In the garden of spiritual interplay
              As the World Spirit awaits its portrait.
